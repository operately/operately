# TurboUI Development Guide

This document captures the architecture principles, patterns, and workflow for developing components in the turboui library - a React-based component system for Operately's work management software, featuring goal tracking, project management, task management, and team communication.

## Architecture Principles

### Component Design

- **Self-contained components**: Components should manage their own state when possible, using callbacks to notify parents of changes
- **Generic callbacks**: Prefer generic update callbacks (e.g., `onTaskUpdate`, `onMilestoneUpdate`) over specific ones (e.g., `onAssigneeChange`, `onDueDateChange`)
- **No mock data in components**: Mock data belongs in Storybook stories, not in component files
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain compatibility where possible when refactoring

### State Management

- **Local state with parent notification**: Components maintain local state and notify parents via callbacks
- **Callback patterns**: Use `(id: string, updates: Partial<Type>) => void` for update callbacks

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode**: Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined with no implicit any
- **Shared types**: Use centralized type files to avoid circular dependencies
- **Interface consistency**: Match callback signatures across similar components
- **Prefer named exports over default exports**: Vite and other bundlers have a harder time working with default exports (slower compile speed, flaky name lookup in IDEs)

## Development Workflow

### Setup

1. **Storybook development**: Components are developed and tested in Storybook
2. **TypeScript checking**: Run `make turboui.build && make turboui.test` regularly
3. **Component stories**: Create comprehensive stories showing all component states
4. **Auto-formatting**: Claude Code will automatically run Prettier on file edits (configured in `.claude/settings.json`)

### Tips

- **Ask, do not assume**: If requirements are not 100% clear do not jump into implementation with assumptions but ask for clarifications and present options if possible.

### Design Iteration and Feedback

- **Question layout decisions**: If placement feels visually awkward or breaks established patterns, discuss alternatives before implementing
- **Consider integration over isolation**: New UI elements often work better integrated into existing containers rather than as standalone floating elements
- **Design system is evolving**: Be flexible with color/component choices while preferring established patterns when available

### File Organization

```
src/
├── ComponentName/
│   ├── index.tsx              # Main component
│   ├── index.stories.tsx      # Storybook stories
│   └── types.ts              # Component-specific types (if needed)
├── TaskBoard/
│   ├── components/           # TaskBoard-specific components
│   ├── stories/             # TaskBoard stories
│   ├── tests/               # Mock data and utilities
│   ├── utils/               # Shared utilities
│   └── types.ts             # Shared TaskBoard types
```

### Story Development

- **State management**: Use React state in story decorators for interactivity
- **Comprehensive examples**: Show empty states, error states, loading states
- **Interactive callbacks**: Implement all callbacks with console logging
- **Mock data**: Create realistic test data that demonstrates all features

## Testing & Quality

### TypeScript Checks

Always run before committing:

```bash
make turboui.build && make turboui.test
```

### Common Issues

- **Type mismatches**: `Date | null` vs `Date | undefined` - use `value || undefined`
- **Missing callbacks**: Ensure interactive components receive appropriate update callbacks
- **Prop drilling**: Use callback props to pass updates up the component tree
- **State synchronization**: Keep local state in sync with parent state via useEffect

## Design System

### Visual Consistency

- **Icons**: Use Tabler icons consistently, hide in list contexts to reduce clutter
- **Colors**: Use existing color classes (content-subtle, content-error, etc.) defined in tailwind config and outlined in turboui/src/Colors
- **Spacing**: Use consistent gap and padding patterns

### Design System Colors and Theming

- **Prefer design system colors first**: Check `src/Colors/Colors.stories.tsx` for available semantic colors before using Tailwind classes
- **Dark mode support**: Design system colors automatically support dark mode; custom Tailwind colors may not
- **Fallback to Tailwind when needed**: If design system colors don't meet the need, Tailwind classes are acceptable (expect this ~10-20% of cases)
- **Check existing patterns**: Look at similar components (e.g., `src/Callouts/index.tsx` for status messaging) to understand established color usage

### Component Discovery and Imports

- **Verify component exports**: Use Task tool or check actual import files when uncertain about available components/icons
- **Don't assume standard names**: Button components use specific variants (`PrimaryButton`, etc.), not generic names
- **Check icon availability**: Icons follow `Icon[Name]` pattern - verify existence in `src/icons/index.tsx` before using

### Interaction Patterns

- **Hover reveal**: Use opacity transitions for discoverable actions
- **Loading states**: Show appropriate feedback during async operations
- **Error states**: Clear error messaging and recovery paths
- **Empty states**: Helpful guidance for first-time users

## Design System Principles

### Visual Cohesion and Grouping

- **Container-based thinking**: When controls feel disconnected, wrap them in a unified container with consistent backgrounds, borders, and spacing
- **Visual hierarchy through grouping**: Related functionality should be visually grouped together (e.g., header controls for a data section)
- **Prevent layout drift**: Use containers to maintain visual structure even in empty states
- **Follow established patterns**: Look to existing components for consistent container and header patterns

### Empty State Design

- **Always design for empty states**: Every list, collection, or data display needs a thoughtful empty state
- **Actionable empty states**: Include clear instructions and prominent CTAs that guide users to the next step
- **Maintain visual structure**: Empty states should preserve the same visual container as populated states
- **Guide user intent**: Make the primary action obvious and accessible in empty states

### Component Layout Principles

- **Inline vs. stacked elements**: Related controls that act on the same data should flow together horizontally when possible
- **Breathing room matters**: Use consistent spacing to prevent cramped layouts - increase spacing values when elements feel tight
- **Primary action prominence**: Make the most important action visually prominent and contextually placed
- **Visual weight balance**: Avoid layouts with unbalanced white space or heavy clustering in one area

### Consistency Guidelines

- **Match existing patterns**: When designing new sections, reference similar existing components for typography, spacing, and interaction patterns
- **Standardize component variants**: Use consistent button types and component choices across similar use cases
- **Typography consistency**: Match header sizes and styles across similar sections throughout the application
- **Use standard components**: Always use design system components (Link variants, Button variants) instead of custom implementations

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Use hotkeys-js library
- Keep shortcuts lightweight and scoped; do not interfere with text inputs.
- Always provide a clickable alternative.

### Pattern Recognition and Component Reuse

**When implementing similar functionality:**

- **Always examine reference implementations first**: If the user mentions "like [ComponentA]" or "similar to [ComponentB]", immediately examine those components for reusable patterns, shared components, or identical implementations
- **Look for shared components**: Components like `SectionHeader`, spacing classes, button patterns, etc. are often standardized across the app - import and use them rather than recreating
- **Copy exact patterns**: Don't recreate; copy the exact component structure, class names (`font-bold`, `mt-2`, `size=\"xxs\"`), spacing, and interaction patterns from the referenced examples
- **Start with reference implementation**: Read the reference component fully before writing new code, then copy the identical structure and customize only as needed

**Implementation efficiency:**

- **Match exactly first, customize second**: Get the implementation identical to the reference, then make specific adjustments if needed
- **Note component hierarchy**: How headers, buttons, and content are structured and positioned in reference implementations
- **Identify reusable pieces**: Extract shared utilities, hooks, or helper functions that should be reused rather than rebuilt

### Coding Practices

- Avoid `@ts-ignore`. Prefer proper typing, narrow with type guards, or use `@ts-expect-error` sparingly with a clear comment explaining why.
- Avoid `as any`. Use precise types, React utilities (`Children.toArray`, `isValidElement`), and safe fallbacks instead of broad casts.
- Use descriptive, self-explanatory names. Eg., prefer `isScreenReaderOnly` over `isSrOnly`, `openInlineCreator` over `open` when scope is ambiguous.
- Provide sane defaults to prevent crashes when data is incomplete.

### Interactive Design

- **Contextual placement**: Place actions near the content they affect rather than in distant headers or sidebars
- **State management**: Ensure interactive elements actually update state in stories and implementations for realistic behavior
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show advanced controls contextually within their relevant sections rather than globally
- **Clear affordances**: Make interactive elements obviously clickable and provide clear feedback on state changes
