    Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics for organizations across the globe. The

    DORA includes some fancy stuff that is mentioned in this line

    SuperPace will do something called Y, instead of X

    SuperPace utilizes cutting-edge data collection and analytics technologies to
    meticulously gather, measure, and interpret key DORA metrics, including
    deployment frequency, lead time for changes, time to restore service, and
    change failure rate. By translating these metrics into practical insights,
    SuperPace fosters continuous learning, enhances collaboration, and accelerates
    the pace of innovation in the complex, fast-paced world.
