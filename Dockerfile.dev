# If we run everything as root, we can't mount the source code as a volume
# because the volume will be owned by root. This is a problem because the
# source code is owned by the user on the host machine. If we run everything
# as the user, we can mount the source code as a volume and the user on the
# host machine can edit the source code and the changes will be reflected
# inside the container.

# Create a user with the same UID and GID as the user on the host machine.
# This way, the user inside the container will have the same permissions as
# the user on the host machine.
