## Technical Implementation Recommendations

### Recommended Architecture for Operately

Based on the research findings, here's the recommended approach for Operately's beacon implementation:

#### Phase 1: Simple HTTP Beacon (Immediate Implementation)
```elixir
defmodule Operately.Telemetry.Beacon do
  @moduledoc """
  Simple beacon implementation for collecting anonymized installation metrics
  """
  
  use GenServer
  require Logger
  
  @beacon_interval :timer.hours(24) # Daily ping
  @beacon_url "https://telemetry.operately.com/ping"
  
  def start_link(_) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: __MODULE__)
  end
  
  def init(state) do
    if beacon_enabled?() do
      schedule_beacon()
    end
    {:ok, state}
  end
  
  def handle_info(:send_beacon, state) do
    send_beacon_data()
    schedule_beacon()
    {:noreply, state}
  end
  
  defp send_beacon_data do
    data = %{
      installation_id: installation_id(),
      version: Application.spec(:operately, :vsn),
      elixir_version: System.version(),
      otp_version: System.otp_release(),
      platform: platform_info(),
      deployment_type: deployment_type(),
      user_count_range: user_count_range(),
      timestamp: DateTime.utc_now()
    }
    
    Task.async(fn ->
      HTTPoison.post(@beacon_url, Jason.encode!(data), 
        [{"Content-Type", "application/json"}],
        timeout: 10_000, recv_timeout: 10_000
      )
    end)
  end
  
  defp beacon_enabled? do
    System.get_env("OPERATELY_BEACON_ENABLED", "true") == "true"
  end
  
  defp installation_id do
    # Generate or retrieve persistent anonymous ID
    case Operately.Settings.get("installation_id") do
      nil -> 
        id = UUID.uuid4()
        Operately.Settings.put("installation_id", id)
        id
      id -> id
    end
  end
  
  defp schedule_beacon do
    Process.send_after(self(), :send_beacon, @beacon_interval)
  end
end
```

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics (Future Enhancement)
- Add optional usage metrics (project count ranges, activity patterns)
- Implement retry logic and offline queuing
- Add privacy-preserving analytics dashboard
- Introduce A/B testing capabilities

#### Privacy and Configuration
```elixir

  url: {:system, "OPERATELY_BEACON_URL", "https://telemetry.operately.com/ping"},
  interval: {:system, "OPERATELY_BEACON_INTERVAL_HOURS", "24"}
```

Admin interface settings:
- Prominent opt-out option in admin dashboard
