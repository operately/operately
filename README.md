## About the project

Every startup needs to align on goals, run projects, track KPIs, and standardize processes. However, figuring out the right systems that tie everything together is tough, and keeping them in order, even tougher.

That’s why we’re building Operately: to give startups and SMBs the tools to become a high-performance 
organization with 10x less effort.

This project is in alpha and may experience significant changes.
