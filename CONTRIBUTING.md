## Steps to Contribute Code

Follow these steps to make sure that your contribution goes smoothly:

1. Fork the GitHub Repository allowing you to make the changes in your own copy of the repository.
2. Prepare your changes and ensure your commits are descriptive.
3. Ensure that you [sign off on all your commits](/docs/commit_sign-off.md) to comply with the [DCO v1.1](docs/legal/developer_certificate_of_origin.txt)
4. Create a pull request on GitHub.
5. A member of the Operately team will review your code within a week, excluding holidays and either merge, comment, or assign someone for further review.

We'll make sure to provide clear reasoning when this happens.
