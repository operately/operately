defmodule Operately.Demo.Data do
  @moduledoc """
  Data for creating a demo company.

  # Key Field

  Each entity has a 'key' field that is used to identify the entity while creating the demo company.
  You can use the key to reference the entity in other parts of the demo data. For example, you can
  reference a person by their key when adding contributions to the project:

  ```
  people: [
    %{
      key: :ceo      <--- Defined here
      name: "Alice Johnson",
      title: "Chief Executive Officer (CEO)",
      avatar: "photo-1550525811-e5869dd03032",
    }
  ],

  projects: %{
    key: :project_alpha,
    name: "Project Alpha",
    champion: :ceo   <--- Referenced here
  }
  ```

  Each key must be unique within the data set.

  The demo builder will inject the following keys:
    - :company
    - :company_space
    - :owner

  # Avatars

  The avatars are sourced from Unsplash. To add an avatar, go to unsplash.com,
  filter for faces, set that you want to see only free photos, and copy the
  photo ID from the URL.
