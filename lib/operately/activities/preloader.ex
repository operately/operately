  # Takes an activity and returns a list of references to preload
  # that are related to the given schema.
  #
  # The lookup is done by checking the content of the activity
  # and looking for fields that are not yet loaded and are related
  # to the given schema.
  # 
  # The references are returned as a list of tuples with the following
  # structure:
  #
  #   {activity_id, field_name, schema, id}
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   belongs_to :project_a, Operately.Projects.Project
  #   belongs_to :project_b, Operately.Projects.Project
  #
  # Returns:
  #
  #   {activity_id, "project_a", Operately.Projects.Project, "project_a_id"},
  #   {activity_id, "project_b", Operately.Projects.Project, "project_b_id"}
